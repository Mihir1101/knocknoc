# KnocKnoc: Decentralized Media Sharing Platform

Welcome to KnockNoc, a decentralized platform that connects people with similar interests and enables them to share and access audio and video files in a fully decentralized manner. KnockNoc is built on IPFS, integrated with the Lighthouse SDK, and features a decentralized frontend powered by Near BOS (Blockchain Operating System).

## Project Overview

KnockNoc redefines how people share and access multimedia content. By leveraging IPFS and Near BOS, we've created a platform that allows users to publish their audio and video files without relying on a centralized backend. Instead, content is distributed across the decentralized IPFS network, offering privacy, security, and community-driven interactions.

### Key Features

- **Decentralized Content Sharing:** Share your audio and video files directly on the IPFS network, ensuring content availability without a traditional backend.

- **Near BOS Integration:** Seamlessly interact with the Near blockchain through the Lighthouse SDK, enhancing the user experience and facilitating secure transactions.

- **Community Building:** Connect with like-minded individuals based on shared interests, fostering a decentralized and engaging community.

- **User-friendly Interface:** The Near-powered decentralized frontend provides an intuitive way to publish, access, and explore multimedia content.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. You can download them from the official Node.js website: [Node.js Download](https://nodejs.org/)

### Installation

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
